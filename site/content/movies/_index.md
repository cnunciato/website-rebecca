title: Movies
description: >
    Most people know me [as a programmer](https://github.com/cnunciato), and that's cool
    &mdash; but as it turns out, I also studied film [in grad
    school](https://www.chapman.edu/dodge/index.aspx), so I see a lot of movies, and I like to
    keep a record of what I've seen and what I think about them.
