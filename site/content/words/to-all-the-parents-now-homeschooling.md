**Wake up first**. Getting up before the kids is key for me. Having time to do some things
for me before the demands of the day gives me more energy and some internal peace. My
mind and body get a moment before those angelic voices start bickering before they even
get out of bed. Anyone else’s kids fight while still in bed shouting across rooms? No?
Just mine?

Everyone says to have a morning routine but remember to start with small baby steps.
One yoga pose when you get out of bed. Drink a full glass of water. One thing. Then
you can add another tiny step. If you had a morning routine before it may look
different now. The earth operates in seasons and often we do too. Find what works for
this season.

This morning time is protected time for your mind and body. The more time you have to
ground yourself the better you will feel later when the world comes in and starts
trying to knock you around. Save the phone and news and email until after the time for
you. It makes a difference, I promise.

**Blocks and anchors**. Blocks being a chunk of time set aside for a type of task. An
anchor is more fixed, an appointment or meal times. Having a loose structure for the
day gives scaffolding for an otherwise formless and unwieldy stretch of hours.

We usually start school work at 9:30am. This gives the kids time to play and for me to do
some of my own things in the morning. Notice what times of day the kids play well and are
independent. Mine play well after breakfast. I use that time to get some of my thinking
tasks done. By 9:30 it is time to start school work. I still get some of their best time
of day used for school work. It also gives us enough time to get a fair amount of things
done before lunch at 11:00am. Our afternoons are less planned but now that most afternoon
activities are canceled I think naming more blocks and anchors will help. Adding an
afternoon school work time, a quiet time, and a time we do something all together. There
will be lots of play and lots of time when it feels like herding cats. Having a plan of
what I want to cover that day is really helpful. Each kid having a list of assignments has
helped curb rebellious or cranky attitudes. When they know what is expected of them, and
when they will be done for the day they are more self motivated to finish.

**Go outside, with your kids, at least for part of the time**. Even walking the dog around
the block helps us all feel better. Even in the rain, or in the cold, it is better to
get out. A few mins of sky, flowers, spring buds, a snail crossing the sidewalk, a tiny
pinecone. Going outside gives us time from knocking around the house like balls in a
pinball machine. I am not sure if I am the ball or the paddles. Or if we are all balls
and the universe controls the paddles…. If you have a yard or outside space, going out
alone while my kids play inside is one of my favorite things to do, it feels so
indulgent. Sun, air, hot tea and a book is my favorite quiet time.

**Quiet time is another thing that took me years to practice**. Sometimes I catch it in the
moment, when everyone is already quietly occupied, and name it and keep it going. Other
times I wield it as a way to stop fights and create distance so tempers can cool, maybe
mine.

At least 30 minutes seems to be the minimum time to get settled into it and to get
some rest out of it. Or for them to get beyond “I’m bored!”For you this is your quiet
time too. That morning quiet, no matter how long will not last you the whole day. And
for me to feel like a person at the end of the day I need a quiet time too. No news,
no scrolling, no dishes. Nap, read, stare at the wall. Anything quiet or life giving.
Something that gives you rest. With parents juggling school and work at home maybe you
only have time for ten mins with your eyes closed. Make sure you give yourself a break
too, even if it is small.

**Practice life**. All this time at home will make more dirty dishes, more mess, more food
to make. This time at home is time that the kids can practice life skills. Doing their
own laundry. Start with baby steps, they bring it when they are out of their favorite
clothes and declare they have NOTHING to wear. Same goes for making their own food in
the kitchen. Teach them some basic safety in the kitchen and let them cook. Have them
clean. A floor mopped by a child is better than a floor not mopped. They are practicing
and I am letting go of some control. It takes a lot of teamwork to keep everything
running well when everyone is at home. Practice. None of it is done perfectly, we are
all practicing.

**Contact**. All that knocking around like pinballs can create sparks. A hand on the
shoulder, a hug, sitting close while you both work, hold hands, snuggle, a kiss on the
cheek, make eye contact and listen to them tell you about Minecraft. All of these
things reestablish connections and will help soothe nerves and diffuse potential
explosions. This makes a big difference. I can go a whole day in the same room with my
kids and not “connect” with them. Contact soothes us both.

Be well. These are hard times. Protect your relationships. Know that school will look
different at home. The measures of a good day will be different. Pour so much love and
grace on your family.

In my next post I will list some of my favorite homeschooling resources and activities.
