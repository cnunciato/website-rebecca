Three books about love, food and community connected through letters and the love of books during or remembering war times. Set in London and New York, and an Island under occupation. People coming together when times are hard.

These three books are great companion reads. I think these would be beautiful books to read now while times are uncertain. 

Bonus activity: Write a letter to a friend or family member. A letter from someone who cares is always a boost, even if it is only one line. Find that odd piece of old stationery, or a piece of printer paper, one of those great cards from Trader Joe's, and send a note to someone who could use it (i.e., anyone). This is also a great activity for kids. Get handwriting, composition and connection done together! 

There are movies of two of these books. I have not seen them yet, have you? I hesitate because I love the books so much I don’t want to see a different take on them. 

Next I want to read Ruth Reichl’s book _My Kitchen Year_ about her time after the closing of Gourmet magazine. It seems like a next good read. I will let you know how it goes.
