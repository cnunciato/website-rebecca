* Use what you have
* Do what you know
* Finish what you start

I read [these mantras from Myquillin
Smith](https://thenester.com/2019/05/three-mantras.html) and I have not stopped thinking
about them. Even on a good day, I struggle with making choices. When things are upside
down it can be even worse. I look for the next _perfect_ thing, instead of the [next right
thing](http://emilypfreeman.com/podcast/). These words help me get to the next right
thing. It is usually what I already have, what I already know, or what I have already
started.

## Use what you have

I was trying to pick which book to read aloud next with the kids; I wanted to tie it to an
Arrow study (more on this favorite resource in another post) to pack more into the
experience. I read through all the choices, mentally matching the studies up with all the
books we already have. We have collected a lot of books from the thrift store and have a
lot to choose from. _(Ooh, that one looks good! Ooh, that one is a classic!)_ But the mantra
whispered to me and I knew we already had Arrow studies we had not done yet. One of them
being [_The Cricket in Times Square_](https://www.amazon.com/Cricket-Times-Square-Chester-Friends/dp/1427204454/ref=tmm_abk_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=). My youngest has also been listening to Tony Shalhoub
read this as an audio book, and we have the paperback that I can assign to my older boys
as their reading. But I still hesitated. This mantra cuts through all the noise in my head
and asks me to look at where I am, what I have and what I have already started and can
finish.

I used this mantra to pick the next tv show to watch at night. Maybe a silly decision but
one that can take up a lot of brain space. Since it is an election year I have been
thinking about the West Wing. My husband and I never finished the series; now seems like a
good time to start. So have picked it back up starting at season five. It feels good to be
back with familiar characters, and to keep going with a series we always enjoyed.

## Do what you know

I am always looking for the next thing or a new way to do things to make life better, but
often I already know, I just don't want to do it.

There are enough changes and challenges happening right now. I think it is a good time to
lean on what you know. I know I feel stronger and happier when I practice yoga. And I know
I will only do it if I do it first thing in the morning. I can stop trying to tell myself
I will do it later in the day. I won't. _Do what I know_.

I also know that when the kids start to nag me that they need my attention. It will go
better if I give them focused attention. I don't want to. But I know I will fill them up
if I do and I will feel better myself having engaged with them. _Do what I know_. (I am
telling myself this right now as the kids tap at me for attention.)

This also works when I am not feeling like enough. That maybe I need to learn something
new to be be enough for my people. And sometimes I do need something new. But a good place
to start is to do what I know first. I know how to cook, I can spend time with my kids
cooking with them. I love to read, I can share my love of stories with them. Often these
things that I can share I preface with "just": "Eh, I that isn't worth it --- it is _just
soup_." But these things still have value. These are pieces of me that I can share. What
we know is a good place to start, then we can go from there to discover and learn
something new.

## Finish what you start

Oh, this one is a hard one for me. I want to move on to the next thing. There are always
so many things to do. I have piles of unfinished projects, and piles of objects without
homes, unhung picture frames,  holey kid pants I am not ready to throw away waiting to be
mended. Books started, ideas half baked, sentences unfinishedâ€¦

I have conflicting feelings over those undone piles and projects. I want to get them done
but I don't feel up to it. Maybe this is the perfectionist in me that feels it isn't even
worth trying because I won't get it right. I am going to say it, it is the perfectionist
in me fearing that I won't get it _right_. If I can get past my "I don't wanna" and "what if
I do it wrong?" attitude I can usually find some part of the project that I can start and
do what I know. The satisfaction in having finished something is worth all the angst at
the beginning. It gives me a boost of confidence to finish something else.

## An invitation

When I don't know where to begin or what to do next I can hear these mantras whispering in
my head. I hear it as an invitation to be present, to lean into what I already value. To
stand in my own body, to be grounded in who I am, rather than reaching out beyond myself
to grasp at some new thing to save me.

We are all home for a while, not by choice, but we can choose to practice these
invitations to give us a more peaceful experience while we are at home.
